First install npm
1. #npm init --yy
Next install express
2. #npm install --save express
If you have a file to run after these installs, use node file.js command.
Next add a connection file to your mongodb
#file could be named anything.
Next install mongodb before you run the connection file
#npm install mongodb
Use dotenv to remove the sensitive data like connection details
then install the module before running the file
#npm install --save dotenv
With this you are almost through. add the .env file to the gitignore file. But first create the .env file.
#touch .env , touch .gitignore. These commands create files in the root folder.
oNCE ALL IS SET, THEN RUN YOUR CONNECTION file
#node connection.js, it should connect and all is good.
